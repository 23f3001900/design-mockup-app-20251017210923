## Technical Details
- **Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6).
- **Architecture Overview:** Single-page application (SPA) structure with distinct sections for different content areas.  CSS is inlined for simplicity and portability. JavaScript is used for form handling and basic client-side validation. No external libraries are used to keep the application lightweight.

## Code Explanation
-   **Form Handling:** The JavaScript code listens for the form submission event, prevents the default submission behavior, validates the email field, and simulates a successful submission with an alert.  In a real-world application, the form data would be sent to a server-side endpoint using `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`.
-   **Responsive Design:** CSS media queries are used to adjust the layout and font sizes for different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on mobile devices and desktops.
-   **Animations:** CSS `transition` property is used to create subtle animations for button hover effects and card transformations.
